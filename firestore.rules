/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the VerifyAI platform.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - All user data and associated verification records are nested under the `/users/{userId}` path.
 * - Each user has their own `textVerifications`, `imageVerifications`, and `videoVerifications` subcollections.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - Listing other users is disallowed.
 * - Data schema is not strictly enforced during this prototyping phase, but ownership is.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `userId` is embedded in the document path, allowing for efficient ownership checks without additional `get()` calls.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-specific data (verifications) is stored in user subcollections, guaranteeing data privacy.
